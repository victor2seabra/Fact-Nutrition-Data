# Fact-Nutrition-Data
On this project I was challenged to solve questions on regards of nutrition data from a csv file given by the platform DataCamp.

Questions made like which fruits is the richest on Vitamin C, how is composed a diet with no carbohydrates and a diet rich in protein, the relation between the water content in food products and its caloric value and using a linear regression model validate the estimative made by the Cleveland Clinic on the caloric content per gram of protein, fat and carbohydrate.
